# Python - if/else, loops, functions
This project is about if/else, loops and functions in Python.
## General
In this project we were able to:
* Use the `if`, `if ... else` statements
* Use comments
* Affect values to variables
* Use the `while` and `for` loops
* Use the `break` and `continues` statements
* Use `else` clauses on loops
* Use `range`
## Tasks
0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
	* This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `number` is positive or negative.
1. The last digit
	* This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `number`.
2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
	* Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
	* Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
