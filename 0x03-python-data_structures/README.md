# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
In this project we have learned new Concept in Python; Data Structures: Lists and Tuples.
## General
In this project we were able to:
	* use lists as stacks and queues.
	* use tuples versus lists
	* understand what is a sequence and tuple packing
	* understand what is sequence unpacking.
	* Use the del statement.
## Tasks
0. Print a list of integers
	* Write a function that prints all integers of a list.

		* Prototype: `def print_list_integer(my_list=[]):`
1. Secure access to an element in a list
	* Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.

		* Prototype: `def element_at(my_list, idx):`
2. Replace element
	* Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).

		Prototype: `def replace_in_list(my_list, idx, element):`
3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!
	* Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.

		* Prototype: `def print_reversed_list_integer(my_list=[]):`
4. Replace in a copy
	* Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).

		* Prototype: `def new_in_list(my_list, idx, element):`
5. Can you C me now?
	* Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.

		* Prototype: `def no_c(my_string):`
6. Lists of lists = Matrix
	* Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.

		* Prototype: `def print_matrix_integer(matrix=[[]]):`
7. Tuples addition
	* Write a function that adds 2 tuples.

		* Prototype: `def add_tuple(tuple_a=(), tuple_b=()):`
