# Python - Object-relational mapping
This project is about Object relational mapping (ORM) using __Python__.

## General
In this project We were able to:
* learn how to connect to a MySQL database from a Python script.
* learn how to `SELECT` rows in a MySQL table from a Python script.
* learn how to `INSERT` rows in a MySQL table from a Python script.
* learn how to map a Python Class to a MySQL table
* learn how to create a Python Virtual Environment.

## Tasks
0. Get all states
* Write a Python script that lists all states from the database `hbtn_0e_0_usa`

1. Filter states
* Write a Python script that lists all `states` with a `name` starting with `N` (upper N) from the database `hbtn_0e_0_usa`.

2. Filter states by user input
* Write a Python script that takes in an argument and displays all values in the `states` table of `hbtn_0e_0_usa` where `name` matches the argument.

3. SQL Injection...
* Once again, write a Python script that takes in arguments and displays all values in the `states` table of `hbtn_0e_0_usa` where `name` matches the argument. But this time, write one that is safe from MySQL injections!

4. Cities by states
* Write a Python script that lists all `cities` from the database `hbtn_0e_4_usa`.
