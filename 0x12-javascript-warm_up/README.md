# JavaScript - Warm up
This project covers the principles of __JavaScript__ language.

## General
In this project we were able to:
* run a JavaScript script
* create variables and constants.
* learn the differences between var, const and let.
* use the `if`, `if ... else` statements.
* use comments.
* affect values to variables.
* use `while` and `for` loops.
* use break and continue statements.
* use functions.
* manipulate dictionary.
